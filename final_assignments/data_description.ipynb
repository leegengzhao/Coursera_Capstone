    "The United States and Canada population are increasingly mobile. People move and relocate for various reasons. For example, people move from one metropolitan area to another because they are changing jobs. However, metropolitan areas such as large cities all have their own economic, social, and cultural characteristics and these characteristics are reflected among their unique neighborhoods and communities. For people planning relocation, any knowledge related to the neighborhoods of their destination cities and how they are similar or dissimilar to their current city neighborhoods will be valuable. For example, it may help people find their desired places to live in their new cities.\n",

    "There are of course many different aspects that we can use when describing city neighborhoods and comparing them, such as populations, housing prices, traffic, and crime rates. For this project, we will focus on neighborhood points of interests (POIs) or venues."
